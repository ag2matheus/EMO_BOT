and this vanity i'm breaking lets me live my life like this, and well, i find it hard to stay with the words you say
oh baby, let me in
let's say goodbye the hundredth time and then tomorrow, we'll do it again
we could be perfect one last night and die like star-crossed lovers when we fight
stand up fucking tall, don't let them see your back, and take my fucking hand and never be afraid again
just because my hand’s around your throat, doesn’t mean i don’t love you!
hello angel, tell me where are you? tell me where we go from here
late dawns and early sunsets just like my favorite scenes, then holding hands and life was perfect just like up on the screen
and in saying you loved me made things harder, at best
i'd photocopy all the things that we could be, if you took the time to notice me, but you can't now, i don't blame you, and it's not your fault that no one ever does
i would drive on to the end with you, a liquor store or two keeps the gas tank full
if you were here, i'd never have a fear, so go on, live your life but i miss you more than i did yesterday
pain in my heart for your dying wish, i'll kiss your lips again
and for the last night i lie, could i lie with you?
so give me all your poison, and give me all your pills, and give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill
give me a shot to remember and you can take all the pain away from me, your kiss and i will surrender
when you go, and would you even turn to say "i don't love you like i did yesterday"?
i will not kiss you 'cause the hardest part of this is leaving you
i'm the kind of human wreckage that you love
if there's a place that i could be, then i'd be another memory, can i be the only hope for you? because you're the only hope for me
and if we can't find where we belong, we'll have to make it on our own
count to seventeen and close your eyes, i'll keep you safe inside
and if you stay, i would even wait all night, or until my heart explodes, how long until we find our way in the dark and out of harm? you can run away with me anytime you want
'cause i wanted you to know that the world is ugly but you’re beautiful to me, well are you thinking of me now?
if i could be with you tonight, i would sing you to sleep, never let them take the light behind your eyes
give me envy, give me malice, give me your attention
and isn't this exactly where you'd like me? i'm exactly where you'd like me, you know, praying for love in a lap dance and paying in naivety?
you remind me of a former love, that i once knew, and you carry a little piece with you
if all our life is but a dream, fantastic posing greed, then we should feed our jewelry to the sea, for diamonds do appear to be, just like broken glass to me
sugarcane in the easy morning, weathervanes my one and lonely
i missed your skin when you were east, you clicked your heels and wished for me
i know the world’s a broken bone but melt your headaches, call it home
i don't love you, i'm just passing the time, you could love me if i knew how to lie
say what you mean, tell me i'm right, and let the sun rain down on me, give me a sign, i wanna believe
are you worth your weight in gold? 'cause you're behind my eyelids when i'm all alone
you could tell me secrets that i'll probably repeat, i'm not trying to hurt you, i just love to speak
you need him, i could be him
my badge, my witness means that i believed every single lie you said
and if i could move, i'm sure it would only be to crawl back to you
i hate the way you say my name like it's something secret
so, and when it all goes to hell, will you be able to tell me "sorry" with a straight face?
i used to waste my time dreaming of being alive (now i only waste it dreaming of you)
i've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
oh, don't mind me, i'm watching you two from the closet wishing to be the friction in your jeans, isn't it messed up how i'm just dying to be him?
i keep my jealousy close cause it's all mine, and if you say this makes you happy, then i'm not the only one lying
keep quiet, nothing comes as easy as you, can i lay in your bed all day? i'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
so wear me like a locket around your throat, i'll weigh you down, i'll watch you choke, you look so good in blue
i keep you warm and won't ask you where you've been
and you're the only place that feels like home, just so you know, you'll never know, and some secrets weren't meant to be told
best friends, ex-friends 'til the end, better off as lovers and not the other way around
i've loved everything about you that hurt
i sleep with your old shirts and walk through this house in your shoes, it's a strange way of saying that i know i'm supposed to love you
say my name and his in the same breath, i dare you to say they taste the same
i want to scream "i love you" from the top of my lungs but i'm afraid that someone else will hear me
i don't know where you're going but do you got room for one more troubled soul?
i don't believe a word you say but i can't stop listening
you know i only wanted fun and you got me all fucked up on love
but i'm no good, good at lip service, except when they're yours, mi amor, i'm coming for you and i'm making war
did you ever love her? do you know? or did you never want to be alone?
it was the fourth of july, you and i were fire, fireworks that went off too soon, and I miss you in the june gloom too
i said i'd never miss you but i guess you never know, may the bridges i have burned light my way back home
i'll be as honest as you'll let me, i miss your early morning company, if you get me, you are my favorite what if, you are my best i'll never know
i wish i'd known how much you loved me, i wish I cared enough to know
stay with me, this is what i need
i wonder how am i supposed to feel when you're not here? 'cause i burned every bridge i ever built when you were here
i'd rather waste my life pretending than have to forget you for one whole minute
and that was the day that i promised i'd never sing of love if it does not exist but, darling, you are the only exception
and all the best lies, they are told with fingers tied, so cross them tight
now i've got a feeling if i sang this loud enough, you would sing it back to me
i'm trying to find my place but it might not be here where i feel safe
all i wanted was you
the truth is hiding in your eyes and it's hanging on your tongue, just boiling in my blood but you think that i can't see, what kind of man that you are, if you're a man at all
i'm screaming, "i love you so" but my thoughts you can't decode
ooh, there is something i see in you, it might kill me, but i want it to be true
aren't you tired of always being mad at the world?
i got a love i would die for and a song to sing, maybe we're both just living out our dream
we live alone, two different worlds, me in a fantasy, you in your memories but we get along
i want to get out and build my own home on a street where reality is not much different from dreams i've had
it's not that i won't remember where i'm from, just don't want to be here no more
well i could be angry but you're not worth the fight
let 'em say what's right and wrong, let 'em do their thing 'cause that will never be you and me
dancing all alone to the sound of an enemy's song, i'll be lost until you find me
what a mess, what a mystery we've made of love and other simple things 
i question every human who won't look in my eyes, scars left on my heart formed patterns in my mind
like the moon we borrow our light, i am nothing but a shadow in the night, so if you let me i will catch fire
it's not a walk in the park to love each other but when our fingers interlock, can't deny you're worth it
'cause after all this time, i'm still into you
recount the night that i first met your mother, and on the drive back to my house i told you that i loved ya
some things just make sense and one of those is you and i 
baby, not a day goes by that i'm not into you
i can’t cry in your arms ‘cause you’re not here
my heart is bigger than the distance in between us, i know it ‘cause i feel it beating
i bet your skin is warm and that you're smiling, that’s what i always loved the most about you
i'll believe in what you say, there’s nothing left for you to do, the only proof that i need is you
now when you say you want to slow down, does it mean you want to slow dance?
you should be alone with me
i'm a loner, i'm in love with you alone
should i write myself out of the history books and mark a place in time for every chance you took?
we'll keep a secret if you keep me guessing, the taste of your lips says we shouldn't have met like this
lipstick has a way of leaving more than just a mark on my sheets, coloring my senses cherry red, at least for this week
i'm sick and tired of writing songs about you
you're dressed to kill, i'm calling you out (don't waste your time on me)
call me a name, kill me with words, forget about me, it's what i deserve
sing me to sleep, i'll see you in my dreams, waiting to say, "i miss you. i'm so sorry."
show us off to all your friends, we're the trophy boys from here to if and when we break and break your dreams of keeping us a secret
i'm just a face for every picture, a smile for your scrap-books and a story to be told but i'm loving every second
fall in the grave i've been digging myself but there's room for two six feet under the stars
too much of you is never enough
when the lights go off, i want to watch the way you take the stage by storm, the way you wrap those boys around your finger
take me, show me the corners of your empty room, the trouble we could get into, just fake it for me
i confess, tonight i'm dressed up in gold, you've got me fucked up and sold
you're only happy when i'm wasted, i point my finger but i just can't place it, feels like i'm falling in love when i'm falling to the bathroom floor
tonight's like a knife, would you cut me with your kiss?
i bleed, red lips, you're unbelievable, can't miss this chance to take you, and here's my invitation
i'm gonna break down these walls i built around myself, i wanna fall so in love with you and no one else could ever mean half as much to me as you do now
you drank the poison and i let you in, would you trade that heart of gold for a minute in my skin?
i'm a walking disaster, they told you to stay away
you said just friends and no strings but that leaves loose ends for old flings
how do i get away when you're begging me to stay?
there's a piece of me tells me i shouldn't leave everytime I see your face because everytime you come around, love, you take my breath away
you're just a daydream away, i wouldn't know what to say if i had you, and i'll keep you a daydream away, just watch from a safe place so i never have to lose
i would drink a little too much, you'd offer me a ride and i would offer you a t-shirt and you would stay another night
i won't give up on you, these scars won't tear us apart, so don't give up on me, it's not too late for us, and i'll save you from yourself
can you fix the broken? can you feel my heart?
so come and sing me to sleep, i dealt with too much fuckin' shit and now i'm in too deep, cut off my wings, my flowers bloomed, you want salvation? well, i'm sorry, we're all doomed
so don't even try to cry me a river, 'cause i forgive you, you are the reason i still fight
save me from myself, don't let me drown
hello, there, the angel from my nightmare
we can live like jack and sally if we want, where you can always find me and we'll have halloween on christmas, and in the night, we'll wish this never ends
don't waste your time on me, you're already the voice inside my head (i miss you, i miss you)
i'll try to kiss you if you let me (this can't be the end)
so take a good look, so you'll never forget it, take a deep breath, i know i'm gonna regret it
again, i wait for this to change instead to tear the world in two, another night with her, but i'm always wanting you
here's a letter for you, but the words get confused and the conversation dies, apologize for the past, talk some shit, take it back, are we cursed to this life?
do one thing for me tonight, i'm dying in this silence, the last star left in heaven is falling down to earth and do you still feel the same way?
i will go down as your lover, your friend, give me your lips, and with one kiss, we begin
are you afraid of bein' alone? 'cause i am, i'm lost without you
i'll leave my room open 'til sunrise for you, i'll keep my eyes patiently focused on you, where are you now? i can hear footsteps, i'm dreaming
it's useless, my name has made the list and i wish i gave you one last kiss
fighting the storm, into the blue, and when i lose myself i think of you
why can't we make this darkness feel like home?
we die when love is dead
this used to be our secret, now i'm hiding here alone, can't help but read our names on the wall and wash them off the stone
i trusted you in every way but not enough to make you stay
it's automatic, every word in your letter, a lie that makes me bleed, it's automatic when you say things get better, but they never...
there's no real love in you, why do i keep lovin' you?
when i watch the fading lights, just your shadows touch makes me feel alive
kiss me goodbye into the light like a phantom rider, i'm dying tonight, so dark and cold, i drive alone like a phantom rider, can't make it all on my own
it's cool when you burn me, i love how you hurt me
sick and tired of needing your affection, i chose to be lonely than live without your attention
can i drive you home, can i crash into your life? can you fix my soul, can you break my heart tonight?
i'm standin' on the bridge, i'm waitin' in the dark, i thought that you'd be here by now
isn't anyone tryin' to find me? won't somebody come take me home?
it's a damn cold night, tryin' to figure out this life, won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new? i don't know who you are, but i, i'm with you
is it enough to love? is it enough to breathe? somebody rip my heart out and leave me here to bleed
you came around me, the walls just disappeared, nothing to surround me and keep me from my fears, i'm unprotected, see how i've opened up, oh, you've made me trust
'cause i've never felt like this before, i'm naked around you, does it show? you see right through me and i can't hide, i'm naked around you and it feels so right
you were everything, everything that i wanted, we were meant to be, supposed to be, but we lost it
and all of the memories so close to me just fade away, all this time, you were pretending so much for my happy ending
i'm a scene, i'm a drama queen, i'm the best damn thing that your eyes have ever seen
when you're gone the pieces of my heart are missin' you, when you're gone the face i came to know is missin' too
i wanna lock you up in my closet when no one's around, i wanna put your hand in my pocket because you're allowed
i wanna drive you into the corner and kiss you without a sound, i wanna stay this way forever, i'll say it loud
you make me so hot, make me wanna drop, you're so ridiculous, i can barely stop, i can hardly breathe, you make me wanna scream, you're so fabulous, you're so good to me, baby
you say that i'm messing with your head, all 'cause i was makin' out with your friend
you're on your knees, beggin', "please, stay with me" but honestly, i just need to be a little crazy
yeah, you said "hey" and since that day, you stole my heart and you're the one to blame
and that's why i smile, it's been a while since everyday and everything has felt this right, and now you turn it all around and suddenly, you're all i need, the reason why i smile
i woke up with a new tattoo (your name was on me and my name was on you) i would do it all over again
i like the way you misbehave when we get wasted
bite my lip and close my eyes, take me away to paradise
i'm the son of rage and love
it says "home is where your heart is," but what a shame 'cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
give me a long kiss goodnight and everything'll be alright, tell me that i won't feel a thing so give me novacaine
oh love, oh love, won't you rain on me tonight?
talk myself out of feeling, talk my way out of control, talk myself out of falling in love, falling in love with you, say!
i told you i loved you at the bus station
i'm a rough boy 'round the edges, gettin' drunk and falling into hedges, she's my weakness, fuckin' genius, swear to god, and i'm not even superstitious
i wanna hold you like a gun, we'll shoot the moon into the sun
are you stranded like i'm stranded? do you wanna watch the world fall to pieces?
call my name and save me from the dark
come to bed, don't make me sleep alone, couldn't hide the emptiness, you let it show, never wanted it to be so cold, just didn't drink enough to say you love me
no, we're not gonna waste another moment in this town, and we won't come back, the world is calling out, we'll leave the past in the past, gonna find the future
(close your eyes and please don't let me go)
take my hand tonight, let's not think about tomorrow
i feel like we've been going around in circles, you look at me like i've become a stranger on the street, a skeleton that's been hiding in your closet
i can't bite my tongue forever while you try to play it cool, you can hide behind your stories but don't take me for a fool
you can look into my eyes and pretend all you want but i know your love is just a lie
how does it feel when you kiss when you know that i trust you, and do you think about me when he fucks you?
you'll never know the way it tears me up inside to see you
you look so beautiful today when you're sitting there it's hard for me to look away
the thing I miss the most is waking up next to you, when i look into your eyes, man, i wish that i could stay and i can't lie
(so why do you tell me you care if you're not gonna stay?) and my heart's still burning
i'd do anything just to hold you in my arms, to try to make you laugh 'cause somehow i can't put you in the past
i'd do anything just to fall asleep with you, will you remember me? 'cause i know i won't forget you
if you miss me, have no fear, i'll be here, i'll be waiting
i wanna feel the way you make me feel when i'm with you, i wanna be the only hand you need to hold on to
i guess i'll never get to call you mine
i'm sick of being alone, when are you coming home?
i'm never gonna be good enough for you, can't pretend that i'm alright and you can't change me
so thank you for showing me that best friends cannot be trusted
